Hello Guys this README for indexing exercise.

To get Problem Statements for Playing around indexing in array/list. 

```
GPT-PROMPT-FOR-PROBEM-SETS:
just like problem statement given, we have to work with indices of array/list. I want to practice more with similar problem statment. Lets work with sexercises mall exercises. give me new problem statments along the path. first bigineer then intermidiate and professional code block for Data scientiest for list topic. 

Problem: Given nums, an array of integers, and target, find indices of the two numbers whose sum equals target.
Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Solution: [0, 1] (nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)
